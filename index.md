## about me

Hi! I'm currently a postdoc at Caltech working with the [DSA-2000](https://www.deepsynoptic.org/overview) and [CHIME/FRB](https://www.chime-frb.ca/) collaborations. Previously, I did my PhD at MIT with [Prof. Kiyoshi Masui](https://www.kiyomasui.info/). 

My PhD work was with CHIME/FRB. I worked with [Catalog 1](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..257...59C/abstract), using our [injections system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....165..152M/abstract) to understand intrinsic FRB property distributions, as well as their [energy and distance distributions](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...944..105S/abstract). Some basic data products from that work can be found [here](https://github.com/kaitshin/CHIMEFRB-Cat1-Energy-Dist-Distrs/).
Despite my populations work, I am fond of some [individual FRBs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241007307S/abstract) and what we can learn from them.
I've also helped discover a few extremely active repeating FRB sources (e.g., [FRB 20240114A](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250513297S/abstract) and [FRB 20240209A](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...979L..21S/abstract)).

Nowadays, with CHIME/FRB, I maintain and lead our [baseband localization pipeline](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910..147M/abstract) efforts, and am currently leading our second baseband catalog effort ("BaseCat2"). (I made the main data products for [BaseCat1](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...969..145C/abstract) — check out the data [here](https://www.chime-frb.ca/baseband-catalog-1)!)


## research interests

- **Fast radio bursts (FRBs)**: discovering them, localizing them, following up their host galaxies, investigating their use as probes of diffuse matter... you name it, I'm (probably) interested in it!
- **Long-period radio transients**: studying their multiwavelength behavior (especially optical + X-ray), and of course, also discovering more :)
- **Other weird things?**: I'm involved with UV/O/IR time-domain surveys of globular clusters, hoping to identify some fun, weird radio transients with multi-wavelength counterparts.

&#128218; A list of papers I have (co-)authored can be found [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0002-6823-2073&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0).


## other things

Throughout grad school I've been involved with Astrobites, Astronomy on Tap @Boston/Cambridge, MSRP, MIT physREFS.
I'm particularly proud of these Astrobites pieces (a full list can be found [here](https://astrobites.org/author/kshin/)):
- [(2019-10-17) The Nobel Prize for the Foundations of Modern Cosmology](https://astrobites.org/2019/10/17/nobel-prize-foundations-of-modern-cosmology/)
